# BART.GAME
The Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) is a widely recognized computerized behavioral paradigm designed to measure risk-taking propensity in controlled laboratory settings (Lejuez et al., 2002). Participants sequentially inflate virtual balloons, earning monetary rewards for each pump (e.g., 20,000 IRR per pump in Persian adaptations), while facing the escalating risk of explosion that wipes out all earnings for that trial. With a validated burst probability formula. [P_burst = 1/(32-n)], optimal stopping point at 16 pumps, and randomized explosions via the **Math.random()**  algorithm, BART simulates real-world decision-making under uncertainty, capturing metrics such as average pumps, deviation from optimum, and total earnings across structured blocks (3 Blocks × 10 balloons).
BART is extensively used in psychological research to study addiction, gambling, impulsivity, and cognitive learning; in clinical assessments for anxiety and decision-making disorders; and in organizational hiring for high-stakes roles like finance and trading. For Persians and Iranians, this validated tool now offers a localized opportunity through Persian-language interfaces that maximize comprehension and participation—eliminating language barriers for native samples. Iranian researchers can leverage this accessible, culturally adapted format to investigate context-specific factors like social anxiety and anticipated regret on risk-taking, generating reliable data for publications, theses, and international collaborations while advancing behavioral science within Persian-speaking communities.

**BART VALIDATIONS**:

Established Paradigm: BART as risk-taking measure - Gold Standard for lab risk assessment

Controlled Pumps: 30 pumps max (vs original 64) - Prevents extreme scores; standard adaptation

Blocked Design: 3 blocks × 10 balloons - Measures learning over time 

Reward System: 20,000 IRR per pump - Monetary incentive = real motivation

Random Burst: Math.random() algorithm - True randomness; matches original

Burst Formula: P_burst = 1/(32-n) - Exact original equation 

Optimal Stop: 16 pumps benchmark - Mathematical optimum validated

DV Measures: Avg pumps, deviation from 16, total earnings - Standard BART metrics 

Auto-Logging: All data auto-recorded - Eliminates human error

UI Localization: Persian interface - Max comprehension for Iranian sample

Psych Effects: Regret + Social Anxiety - Novel interaction on validated task
